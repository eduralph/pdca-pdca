# Repository integration — pdca-pdca

> What pdca-pdca provides to plug into the generic PDCA cycle (see
> [quality-cycle.md](../PCDA/quality-cycle.md)). This is the project's answer to the
> "which / where / how" questions the generic model deliberately leaves open.
> It does **not** restate the cycle. Conflict rule: generic wins on cycle
> *shape*; this integration wins on *instantiation*.
>
> Copier pre-filled what it could from your answers. Everything marked **TODO**
> or **[planned]** is yours to complete — an unfilled integration means the
> cycle is running on tribal knowledge, the exact failure this doc prevents.
> Maintained by Act (append changes; don't silently rewrite).

## 1. Tracker integration
- **System / URL:** github — https://github.com/eduralph/pdca-harness/issues
- **Issue-ID format:** `#123`
- **Cross-link form (commit/PR → tracker):** TODO (e.g. `Fixes #nnnn` for GitHub Issues)
- **Status → disposition mapping:** TODO
- **Per-release field updated on a fix:** TODO
- **Comment voice / template:** `templates/tracker-comment.md.tpl`

## 2. Branch-target rules
- **Per-area branch map:** default → `main`; TODO any per-area overrides
- **Override convention:** TODO (typically the PR review thread)
- **Cross-version cherry-pick rules:** TODO / none
- **Master-vs-maintenance rule:** TODO (cite the project's own statement)

## 3. Reproduction fixtures and runners
- **Canonical fixture path:** TODO
- **Reproduction runner(s) + commands:** TODO
- **Verification runner (test suite):** TODO
- **Platform variants:** TODO / none
- **What counts as a successful repro:** TODO (exit code / log marker / screenshot)

## 4. Conformance ruleset (answers the validation-tooling matrix for this repo)
For each tier: the **written ruleset** it consumes, its **home**, and the
**single-sourced command** the driver and CI both run. The "Written ruleset"
column is load-bearing — name the project's *normative source* for each tier (a
contributor guide, an addon-dev doc, a PEP/RFC) and, ideally, cite individual
rules back to it (`<doc>:<line>`). A gate you can trace to a written source is
auditable; one you can't is folklore.

Gating policy (see `engine/README.md`): ship every tier **advisory**
(`gating = false`) except the per-fix C4 (red→green). Runtime / conformance /
interface tiers audit code the current fix didn't introduce, so promote a tier to
gating only once its targeted artifacts are clean; gate interface/E2E on a smoke
test, not the full suite.

| Tier | Written ruleset | Home | Single-sourced command | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 structure | TODO | TODO | TODO | [planned] |
| T2 shape | TODO | TODO | TODO | [planned] |
| T3 runtime | TODO | TODO | TODO | [planned] |
| T4 contribution | TODO | fork hooks / PR CI | TODO | [planned] |
| T5 judgment | reviewer contract below | Check reviewer + sign-off | (model) | [planned] |

- **Reviewer family (cross-vendor, ≠ builder):** codex — canonical role body
  `agents/reviewer.md`, inlined for a codex reviewer / resolved via `--agent reviewer` for a
  claude one (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md` renders only when the reviewer family is claude).
  `AGENTS.md` now carries general codex **project context** (STOP discipline, boundaries),
  not the reviewer role.
- **Builder family:** claude — canonical role body `agents/builder.md`; the
  Claude wrapper `.claude/agents/builder.md` (with the ready-mark block enforced by the
  `.claude/hooks/builder_guard.py` PreToolUse hook) is materialized only when the builder
  family is claude. A codex builder runs `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write`, confined to
  the worktree cwd.
- **Interactive family:** claude — the human-in-the-loop leaves (Plan,
  Sign-off, Publish, Act) run a seeded `claude --agent <name>` REPL or a `codex` TUI, chosen
  by `interactive_family`. A codex publisher gets the same `gh` STOP-shim the builder does
  (it has no PreToolUse hook), so it can't `gh pr ready`/`merge`.
- **Role prompts (vendor-neutral source):** each leaf's instructions live once in
  `agents/<name>.md`. Claude leaves also get `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (frontmatter wrapper
  that includes that body, so `--agent` resolves); non-Claude (inline) leaves read the
  `agents/` body directly. Only Claude leaves carry a `.claude/agents/` file.
- **Vendor profiles:** every family-specific behavior (streaming, extra-dir grounding,
  role-prompt injection, STOP-guard mechanism) is data in `pdca_harness.families`,
  overridable via `pdca.toml [families.<name>]` — swapping or adding a vendor is a
  config edit, not a driver change. A non-claude builder gets the STOP discipline
  from the driver's `gh` PATH shim (same `builder_guard.py` rules as the claude hook).
- **Project-defined human-only items** (reviewer emits NEEDS-HUMAN by design): TODO
  enumerate them so the model knows when to defer and the human what to expect.

## 5. Upstream-isn't-ahead routine
- **What "upstream" is:** TODO (canonical URL, branches, fork relationship)
- **Search routine + tokenization gotchas:** TODO (search by affected file path)
- **Merged-history check command:** TODO (`git log` / `gh search` invocation)

## 6. Brief and design-proposal templates
- **Brief template:** `templates/brief.md.tpl`
- **Design-proposal template:** `templates/design-proposal.md.tpl` [built] — the
  Plan artifact for the **exception** (major architecture / API / data-model / UX).
  The planner reserves it for changes that warrant a proposal; most work uses the
  brief. Any canonical upstream process (GEPS/RFC) still owns the final document;
  the cycle produces the draft + the Do spec.
- **Required project-specific frontmatter/sections:** TODO / none

## 7. Bundle and act-log paths
- **Bundle root + ID format:** `results/issue_<id>/`
- **Act log path:** `process/act-log.md`
- **Iterate archive:** a rejected attempt is preserved in `iteration-v<N>/` in the
  bundle (the brief is archived with it on iterate-to-Plan) — fixed by the harness

## 8. Committing and PR conventions
- **Commit-message format:** TODO (subject length, wrap column, trailer, refs)
- **PR description format:** see `templates/pr-description.md.tpl` (Root cause / Fix / Verified against / Test)
- **Enforcement mechanism:** TODO (commit-msg hook / PR CI / human review)

## 9. Repo-specific scripts and tooling
List every project-specific script the cycle invokes (role → path + invocation + status).

| Role | Path | Invocation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tracker scrape / handoff generator | TODO | | [planned] |
| Conformance gate runners | TODO | | [planned] |
| Repro / verification runners | TODO | | [planned] |
| Driver | `src/pdca_harness/` | `pdca-pdca run <id>` | [built — stub leaves] |
| Act tooling (L4) | `src/pdca_harness/act.py` | `pdca-pdca act index`, `pdca-pdca act log --date <d>` | [built] |
| Gates (single-sourced) | `pdca.toml` `[[gates.checks]]` | `pdca-pdca gates [<id>] [--working-tree]` | [built — stub fallback; fill checks] |
| Reviewer role prompt | `agents/reviewer.md` (canonical body; inlined for codex, `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` is the Claude packaging) | (model leaf) | [built — contract; wire command mode] |
| Builder role prompt | `agents/builder.md` (canonical body); `.claude/agents/builder.md` (Claude wrapper) + `.claude/hooks/builder_guard.py` | (model leaf) | [built — ready-mark blocked] |

## 10. Maintainer and governance
- **Who reviews:** Eduard Ralph
- **Ready-mark gate:** TODO (who marks PRs ready, and the convention before the mark)
- **External-contribution flow differences:** TODO / none
- **MAINTAINERS file:** TODO / none

### Composing with the host's CI / PR governance (issue #67)

PDCA **supplements** your existing PR/issue governance; it does not replace it. Map
the harness onto what your host already enforces:

| Host gate (governance layer) | PDCA equivalent (supplement) | How they compose |
|---|---|---|
| require-linked-issue on PRs | `[tracker].issue_trailer` (`Fixes #{id}`) in the publish commit/PR | The trailer satisfies the host's linked-issue rule; `init from brief` maps onto an issue that already passes it. |
| DCO / append-only-doc / ready-mark policy | builder/publisher STOP-discipline (`builder_guard.py` PreToolUse hook) | The hook is a *backstop* that blocks `gh pr ready` / `gh pr merge` for the leaves; your host policy is the authority. |
| Your own CI (`cargo xtask ci`, etc.) | `pdca-pdca gates --working-tree` merge re-gate workflow | Delegate gates to your runner (§4) so both run the *same* checks — no second definition. |

If the host already provides one of these, omit the shipped equivalent at render time:
`ship_ci_workflow = false` drops `.github/workflows/check-gates.yml`; `ship_merge_guard
= false` drops the `builder_guard.py` hook (and its agent wiring). Both default on for a
standalone project.

## 11. Per-repo P-/D-/C-/A- extensions
None today. Add repo-prefixed rules (e.g. `pdca-pdca-C7`) that *tighten
or add to* a generic rule — never weaken one — as running cycles surface them.

## Answering an interactive leaf from another device

The four `interactive = true` leaves — planner, sign-off, publisher, Act — hand the terminal
to a human+model REPL and block there. That means the human has to be at the terminal the
flow runs in, for the whole batch: a `pdca flow` over several bundles can park on one
sign-off adjudication for hours because nobody is at that machine.

Claude Code's `--remote-control` flag removes the constraint. Append it to an interactive
leaf's `argv` in `pdca.toml` and that leaf becomes answerable from another enrolled device;
nothing else changes — `signoff-decision`, the §6 ticks and the C6 accept-guard all run the
same code path, and only the human's location differs.

Enabling Remote Control in your own shell does **not** reach the leaves: each is a separate
`claude` subprocess whose argv comes from `pdca.toml`. That is the whole reason this needs
documenting.

The headless builder and reviewer must not carry the flag — it starts an *interactive*
session, and they have no human to reach.
